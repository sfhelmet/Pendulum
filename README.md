# System of Pendulums Abstract
The purpose of this research is to further understand the pendulum system. Since
pendulums are unsolvable differential equations, we are challenged to understand
it using different approaches, such as simple harmonic motion, phase portraits, and
Python simulations. These different approaches all bring something to the table to
better understand the system. Also, since we used python, our workload was greatly
reduced from time spent in computation. When looking at the probability aspect of the
pendulum systems, different distributions are explored in order to further understand its motion. In addition, noise can be introduced in these systems in order to
get a better understanding of the chaos and randomness which are seen in pendulums. Due to the consequence of noise, double pendulums should be unpredictable
since probability cannot be applied in that specific situation.
